## 🎯 What Was Restored

### **Problem Identified**
The agentic itinerary generation system was implemented in commit `d5d14a8` but accidentally removed in commit `bcbbae5`. User profiles were being generated but **not used** in itinerary creation.

### **Solution Implemented**
Restored the complete agentic system with the following components:

#### 1. **Profile Integration** ✅
- User profile is fetched at the start of itinerary generation
- Profile includes: archetype, preferences, pace, budget, dietary needs
- Graceful fallback if user has no profile

```typescript
// Fetches profile automatically for authenticated users
const profileResult = await getUserTravelProfile();
if (profileResult.success && profileResult.data) {
  travelProfile = profileResult.data;
  console.log(`✅ Profile found: ${travelProfile.archetype}`);
}
```

#### 2. **3-Pass Agentic Itinerary Generation** ✅

**Pass 1: Generate** (Chain-of-thought reasoning)
- Uses agentic prompt with systematic approach
- Includes profile data in prompt if available
- Emphasizes personalization to user preferences

**Pass 2: Validate** (Quality self-reflection)
- Evaluates itinerary on 4 dimensions:
  - Feasibility (30 points): Realistic timing, logical routes
  - Personalization (25 points): Matches profile preferences
  - Balance (25 points): Good activity mix and pacing
  - Detail Quality (20 points): Specific, actionable information
- Generates quality score (0-100)
- Identifies specific issues

**Pass 3: Refine** (Self-improvement)
- Only runs if quality score < 85
- Uses identified issues to improve itinerary
- Maintains what works well
- Returns improved version

#### 3. **Enhanced Prompts** ✅

**Profile Personalization Section:**
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

**`src/lib/actions/ai-actions.ts`**
- ✅ Added imports: `getUserTravelProfile`, `TravelProfile`
- ✅ Profile fetching in `generateItinerary()`
- ✅ Updated `buildPrompt()` to accept and use profile
- ✅ Added `generateItineraryWithModel()` - generates with profile
- ✅ Added `buildAgenticItineraryPrompt()` - chain-of-thought reasoning
- ✅ Added `validateItineraryQuality()` - 4-dimension quality scoring
- ✅ Added `refineItineraryWithModel()` - improvement loop

### Function Flow

```
generateItinerary()
  ├─ Authenticate user
  ├─ Check usage limits
  ├─ getUserTravelProfile() → Fetch profile
  │
  ├─ Pass 1: generateItineraryWithModel()
  │   └─ buildAgenticItineraryPrompt() → Include profile
  │
  ├─ Pass 2: validateItineraryQuality()
  │   └─ Score on 4 dimensions (0-100)
  │
  └─ Pass 3: refineItineraryWithModel() (if score < 85)
      └─ Fix identified issues
```
