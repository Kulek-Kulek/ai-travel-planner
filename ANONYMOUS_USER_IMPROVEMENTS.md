# Anonymous User Experience & UI Improvements

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive set of improvements made to enhance the user experience for both anonymous and authenticated users in the AI Travel Planner application.

---

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Smart Button State Management**

**Problem:** Anonymous users could generate multiple plans, and the button remained enabled during AI processing.

**Solution:**
- Disabled "Generate Itinerary" button when:
  - Plan is being generated (`isLoading`)
  - AI is analyzing user input (`isExtracting`)
  - Plan exists and user is not signed in (`hasResult && !isAuthenticated`)
- Dynamic button text based on state:
  - "Generating Your Itinerary..." with spinner
  - "Analyzing Your Description..." with pulse animation
  - "Sign in to Create Another Plan" when blocked

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/itinerary-form-ai-enhanced.tsx`

---

### 2. **Enhanced Progress Bar Experience**

**Problem:** Progress bar stopped before the plan finished rendering, causing user confusion.

**Solution:**
- Modified progress bar to continue animating until the complete `result` object is populated
- Progress now accurately reflects the entire generation and rendering process

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` (progress bar `useEffect`)

---

### 3. **Auto-Scroll to Sign-In Banner**

**Problem:** Users didn't notice the sign-in prompt after plan generation.

**Solution:**
- Added automatic smooth scroll to the authentication banner on successful plan generation
- Implemented using React ref (`authBannerRef`) and `scrollIntoView()`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx`

---

### 4. **Improved Sign-In/Sign-Up Call-to-Action**

**Problem:** Sign-in banner lacked compelling reasons to create an account.

**Solution:**
Enhanced the banner with clear benefits:
- ‚úÖ Free and takes seconds
- üîí Create private plans
- ‚úèÔ∏è Edit, update, and regenerate plans
- üóëÔ∏è Delete plans
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Plans will be lost without an account

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx`

---

### 5. **Draft Plans for Anonymous Users**

**Problem:** Anonymous plans were immediately published to the public gallery.

**Solution:**
- Anonymous user plans are now saved with `status: 'draft'`
- Drafts are excluded from the public gallery
- When user signs in, draft is automatically claimed and published via `claimDraftItinerary()` action

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/actions/ai-actions.ts`
- `src/lib/actions/itinerary-actions.ts`

---

### 6. **Plan Persistence with SessionStorage**

**Problem:** Users lost their generated plan when navigating to sign-up and returning.

**Solution:**
Implemented client-side persistence using `sessionStorage`:
- `createdPlanWhileLoggedOut` flag to track anonymous plan creation
- `draftItineraryId` to store the plan ID
- Plan preview automatically restored on page return
- Button remains disabled until user authenticates
- SessionStorage cleared upon successful authentication

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx`

---

### 7. **Flexible Account Creation**

**Problem:** "Full Name" requirement was too restrictive.

**Solution:**
- Changed to "Name" field accepting:
  - First name only (e.g., "Kris")
  - Full name (e.g., "Kris Smith")
  - Nickname (e.g., "TravelBug123")
- Used for plan attribution in gallery ("by Kris")

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx`
- `src/lib/actions/auth-actions.ts`
- `supabase/migrations/010_update_profile_name_field.sql`

---

### 8. **Password Confirmation**

**Problem:** Users could make typos when creating passwords.

**Solution:**
- Added "Confirm Password" field
- Implemented Zod validation to ensure passwords match
- Clear error message if passwords don't match

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx`
- `src/lib/actions/auth-actions.ts`

---

### 9. **Plan Attribution in Gallery**

**Problem:** Plans in the gallery and carousel didn't show creator names.

**Solution:**
- Added `creator_name` to `Itinerary` type
- Modified `getPublicItineraries()` to fetch creator names from `profiles` table
- Updated UI components to display "by [Name]" on cards and carousel
- Handles anonymous plans gracefully (no attribution shown)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/actions/itinerary-actions.ts`
- `src/components/itinerary-card.tsx`
- `src/components/masthead.tsx`

---

### 10. **Profile Settings Page**

**Problem:** Users couldn't update their name or password after account creation.

**Solution:**
Created comprehensive profile management:
- Update display name
- Change password (with current password verification)
- Auto-creates profile for legacy users without profiles
- Success/error notifications with toast messages

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/actions/profile-actions.ts`
- `src/components/profile-settings-form.tsx`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(protected)/profile/page.tsx`

---

### 11. **Teaser Preview for Anonymous Users** ‚≠ê

**Problem:** Anonymous users could see entire itinerary without signing up.

**Solution:**
Implemented a compelling preview experience:

#### Visual Restrictions:
- Only Day 1 accordion is openable
- All other days show locked state with padlock icon
- Bottom half of Day 1 content has subtle blur (`blur-[0.5px]`)
- Locked days display hint: "Sign in to unlock this day"

#### Call-to-Action Overlay:
- Beautiful floating card design
- Backdrop blur effect
- ‚úàÔ∏è Airplane icon (travel-themed)
- Headline: "See Your Complete Journey"
- Emphasized day count in brand color
- Benefits listed: "Plus edit, save, and share your plans"

#### Technical Implementation:
- `opacity-60` and `cursor-not-allowed` for locked days
- `select-none` and `pointer-events-none` on blurred content
- Gradient overlay with centered CTA card
- Responsive design with proper spacing

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx`

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Changes

### Migration: `010_update_profile_name_field.sql`

**Purpose:** Make profile name field more flexible

**Changes:**
- Updated `handle_new_user` function to accept `name` or `full_name` from metadata
- Modified trigger to populate `full_name` from user metadata
- Added helpful comment to `profiles.full_name` column
