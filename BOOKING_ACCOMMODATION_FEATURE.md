# Booking.com Accommodation Integration Feature

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating Booking.com accommodation suggestions into the AI Travel Planner app. Since we're a new app without significant traffic, we'll use **deep links with affiliate integration** rather than API access.

## Business Value

- **User Experience**: Provide immediate value by helping users find accommodations that match their trip
- **Revenue Stream**: Generate affiliate commission from Booking.com bookings
- **Competitive Advantage**: Create a one-stop solution for travel planning (itinerary + accommodation)
- **Data Advantage**: We have destination, dates, and traveler count - perfect for personalized recommendations

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Core Implementation

#### 1.1 Create Booking Affiliate Utility

**File**: `src/lib/utils/booking-affiliate.ts`

```typescript
export interface BookingLinkParams {
  destination: string;
  checkIn: Date;
  checkOut: Date;
  adults: number;
  children?: number;
  childAges?: number[];
  rooms?: number;
}

export function generateBookingLink(params: BookingLinkParams): string
export function generateBookingLinks(params: BookingLinkParams): object
```

**Features**:
- Generate deep links to Booking.com with pre-filled search parameters
- Calculate room estimates based on traveler count
- Handle child ages for accurate pricing
- Support multiple accommodation types (hotels, apartments, hostels, resorts)
- Include affiliate ID and tracking labels

**Booking.com URL Parameters**:
- `ss` - Search string (destination)
- `checkin` - Check-in date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `checkout` - Check-out date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `group_adults` - Number of adults
- `group_children` - Number of children
- `no_rooms` - Number of rooms
- `age` - Age of each child (repeated parameter)
- `aid` - Affiliate ID (to be added after registration)
- `label` - Custom tracking label
- `nflt` - Filter by property type (hotels, apartments, etc.)

#### 1.2 Create UI Component

**File**: `src/components/booking-accommodation-card.tsx`

**Features**:
- Clean, visually appealing card design matching app style
- Show trip summary (dates, nights, travelers)
- Primary CTA: "Search Accommodations"
- Expandable options for different accommodation types:
  - 🏨 Hotels & Resorts
  - 🏠 Apartments & Homes
  - 🏢 Hostels
  - 🌴 Resorts
- Clear disclaimer about external link
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

#### 1.3 Integration Points

**Primary Integration**: Itinerary Detail Page
- **File**: `src/app/itinerary/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Placement**: After header card, before itinerary days
- **Condition**: Only show if `start_date` and `end_date` are available
- **Data Source**: Pull from itinerary record (destination, dates, travelers, children)

**Secondary Integration** (Optional): Homepage Results
- **File**: `src/app/page.tsx`
- **Placement**: After generated itinerary preview
- **Condition**: Only show if dates were provided in form
- **Purpose**: Immediate call-to-action while excitement is high

### Phase 2: Affiliate Program Setup

#### 2.1 Register with Booking.com Partner Program

**Steps**:
1. Visit https://partners.booking.com
2. Sign up as an affiliate partner
3. Complete application with:
   - Website: ai-travel-planner domain
   - Traffic estimates: Start with projections
   - Content type: Travel itinerary planning
4. Wait for approval (typically 1-3 business days)
5. Get your Affiliate ID (AID)

#### 2.2 Update Configuration

Once approved, update `src/lib/utils/booking-affiliate.ts`:

```typescript
// Add your affiliate ID
aid: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BOOKING_AFFILIATE_ID || 'YOUR_AFFILIATE_ID',
```

Add to `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BOOKING_AFFILIATE_ID=your_actual_id
```

#### 2.3 Legal Compliance

**Required Disclosures**:
- Add affiliate disclosure to privacy policy
- Include disclaimer on accommodation cards
- Comply with FTC guidelines for affiliate marketing

**Suggested Disclaimer Text**:
> "We partner with Booking.com to help you find accommodations. If you make a booking through our links, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you."

### Phase 3: Analytics & Optimization

#### 3.1 Track Clicks

**File**: `src/app/api/track-affiliate-click/route.ts`

```typescript
// Track when users click accommodation links
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  // Log to database:
  // - itinerary_id
  // - user_id (if logged in)
  // - platform (booking.com)
  // - accommodation_type (hotel, apartment, etc.)
  // - timestamp
}
```

**Database Table**: `affiliate_clicks`

```sql
CREATE TABLE affiliate_clicks (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  itinerary_id uuid REFERENCES itineraries(id),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  platform text NOT NULL,
  accommodation_type text,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

#### 3.2 A/B Testing Ideas

- **Placement**: Above vs below itinerary
- **Design**: Card vs banner vs inline
- **CTA Text**: "Search Accommodations" vs "Find Hotels" vs "Book Now"
- **Timing**: Show immediately vs after user scrolls
- **Personalization**: Show different types based on trip details (family → apartments, solo → hostels)

#### 3.3 Conversion Tracking

Track through Booking.com partner dashboard:
- Click-through rate (CTR)
- Booking conversion rate
- Average commission per booking
- Most popular destinations
- Most popular accommodation types

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features (Future)

#### 4.1 Smart Recommendations

Use AI to suggest accommodation types based on trip characteristics:

```typescript
function suggestAccommodationType(itinerary) {
  // Family with kids → apartments with kitchen
  // Budget travelers → hostels
  // Luxury tags → resorts
  // Business travel → hotels near business district
  // Long stays (7+ days) → apartments
}
```

#### 4.2 Multiple Platform Support

Expand beyond Booking.com:
- **Airbnb**: Deep links for vacation rentals
- **Hotels.com**: Alternative hotel options
- **Expedia**: Package deals (flight + hotel)
- **Hostelworld**: Budget accommodations

#### 4.3 Price Comparison Widget

Show estimated price ranges:
- "Hotels from $80/night"
- "Apartments from $120/night"

*Note: Would require API access or web scraping (check ToS)*

#### 4.4 Map Integration

Show accommodation locations on a map:
- Mark recommended areas based on itinerary
- Highlight proximity to planned activities

#### 4.5 User Preferences

Allow users to set preferences:
- Budget range
- Preferred accommodation type
- Amenities (wifi, parking, breakfast)
- Save preferences in user profile

   - *Backup*: Adjust prominence or remove if not valuable

3. **Poor User Experience**
   - *Mitigation*: Ensure links work perfectly, test thoroughly
   - *Backup*: Add user feedback mechanism to identify issues

4. **Legal Issues**
   - *Mitigation*: Proper disclosures, follow FTC guidelines
   - *Backup*: Consult legal advisor if needed

5. **Technical Issues**
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive error handling, fallbacks
   - *Backup*: Feature flag to disable if problems occur

## Future Expansion Ideas

## Conclusion

This feature represents a natural extension of our travel planning service. By helping users find accommodations with minimal friction, we:
