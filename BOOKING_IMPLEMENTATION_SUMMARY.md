## What Was Built

### 1. Core Utilities (`src/lib/utils/booking-affiliate.ts`)

**Purpose**: Generate Booking.com deep links with pre-filled search parameters

**Key Functions:**
```typescript
// Generate a single booking link with optional property filter
generateBookingLink(params, propertyTypeFilter?)

// Generate links for all 4 accommodation types
generateBookingLinks(params) // Returns: hotels, apartments, hostels, resorts, all

// Validate parameters before link generation
validateBookingParams(params) // Returns: { isValid, errors }
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic date formatting (YYYY-MM-DD)
- ‚úÖ Room estimation based on traveler count
- ‚úÖ Child ages handling (up to multiple children)
- ‚úÖ Property type filters (hotels, apartments, hostels, resorts)
- ‚úÖ Affiliate tracking support (awaiting AID)
- ‚úÖ URL encoding for special characters
- ‚úÖ Currency and language settings

**Parameters Handled:**
- Destination (city, country)
- Check-in & check-out dates
- Number of adults
- Number of children (optional)
- Child ages (optional)
- Room count (auto-estimated or manual)

### 2. UI Component (`src/components/booking-accommodation-card.tsx`)

**Card Sections:**
1. **Header**: "Find Accommodation" with hotel icon
2. **Trip Summary**: Visual display of dates, nights, and travelers
3. **Primary CTA**: "Search All Accommodations" button
4. **Expandable Section**: "Browse by Type" with 4 options:
   - üè® Hotels & Resorts
   - üè† Apartments & Homes
   - üè¢ Hostels

### 3. Integration Point (`src/app/itinerary/[id]/page.tsx`)

**Location**: Itinerary detail page
**Placement**: After header card, before itinerary days
**Conditional**: Only shows if `start_date` AND `end_date` exist

**Data Flow:**
```
Itinerary Data ‚Üí BookingAccommodationCard ‚Üí Booking Utility ‚Üí Booking.com
   ‚îî‚îÄ destination, dates, travelers, children, child_ages
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
{start_date && end_date && (
  <BookingAccommodationCard
    destination={ai_plan.city || destination}
    checkIn={new Date(start_date)}
    checkOut={new Date(end_date)}
    adults={travelers}
    children={children || 0}
    childAges={child_ages}
    className="mb-6"
  />

## Revenue Potential

### Conservative Estimates (1,000 itinerary views/month)

| Metric | Rate | Count | Revenue |
|--------|------|-------|---------|
| Itinerary views | - | 1,000 | - |
| Click-through rate | 20% | 200 clicks | - |
| Conversion rate | 2% | 4 bookings | - |
| Avg. commission | $20 | - | **$80/month** |

### Growth Scenario (10,000 views/month)

- **$800/month revenue**

### Optimized Scenario (25% CTR, 3% conversion)
- 2,500 clicks

### Commission Rates (Booking.com)
- Standard: 25-40% of Booking.com's commission
