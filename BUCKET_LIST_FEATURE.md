# Bucket List Feature Implementation

## Overview

This feature allows users to save itineraries they want to visit in the future to a personal "Bucket List". The feature includes authentication checks and seamless integration with the existing itinerary system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Layer
- ✅ Created `bucket_list` table with RLS policies
- ✅ Established foreign key relationships with `itineraries` and `auth.users`
- ✅ Added unique constraint to prevent duplicate entries
- ✅ Implemented CASCADE deletion for data integrity

### 2. Backend (Server Actions)
- ✅ `addToBucketList(itineraryId)` - Add itinerary to user's bucket list
- ✅ `removeFromBucketList(itineraryId)` - Remove itinerary from bucket list
- ✅ `isInBucketList(itineraryId)` - Check if itinerary is in bucket list
- ✅ `getBucketList()` - Fetch all bucket list items with full itinerary details
- ✅ All actions include proper authentication checks and error handling

### 3. Frontend Components

#### Itinerary Card Updates
- ✅ Heart button now functional with bucket list logic
- ✅ Authentication check: redirects to sign-in if not logged in
- ✅ Visual feedback: filled heart for items already in bucket list
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates
- ✅ Toast notifications for all actions
- ✅ Different views for gallery vs bucket list page

#### Bucket List Page
- ✅ New protected route at `/bucket-list`
- ✅ Beautiful UI with gradient background (red-to-pink)
- ✅ Empty state with helpful messaging
- ✅ Remove button on each card
- ✅ Count of total items
- ✅ Sorted by date added (most recent first)

#### Navigation Updates
- ✅ Desktop navigation: "Bucket List" link with heart icon between "My Plans" and "Profile"
- ✅ Mobile navigation: Same placement and styling
- ✅ Only visible for authenticated users

## Database Migration

### Migration 013: Create Bucket List Table

Apply this migration to enable the bucket list feature:

#### Method 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New query**
5. Copy and paste the following SQL:

```sql
-- Create bucket_list table to store users' saved itineraries
create table bucket_list (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users(id) on delete cascade not null,
  itinerary_id uuid references itineraries(id) on delete cascade not null,
  added_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  
  -- Ensure a user can only add an itinerary to their bucket list once
  unique(user_id, itinerary_id)
);

-- Add indexes for efficient queries
create index bucket_list_user_id_idx on bucket_list(user_id);
create index bucket_list_itinerary_id_idx on bucket_list(itinerary_id);
create index bucket_list_added_at_idx on bucket_list(added_at desc);

-- Enable Row Level Security
alter table bucket_list enable row level security;

-- RLS Policies
-- Users can only view their own bucket list items
create policy "Users can view their own bucket list"
  on bucket_list for select
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can only add to their own bucket list
create policy "Users can add to their own bucket list"
  on bucket_list for insert
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can only delete from their own bucket list
create policy "Users can delete from their own bucket list"
  on bucket_list for delete
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Add a comment for documentation
comment on table bucket_list is 'Stores users saved/favorited itineraries for their bucket list';
```

6. Click **Run** or press `Ctrl+Enter`
7. Verify the migration succeeded (you should see a success message)

#### Method 2: Supabase CLI

If you have Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
cd travel-planner
supabase db push
```

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Authenticated User Adding to Bucket List

1. User is logged in
2. User browses public itineraries on homepage
3. User clicks heart button on an itinerary card
4. System checks if already in bucket list
5. If not, adds to bucket list
6. Shows success toast: "Added to your bucket list! ❤️"
7. Heart button becomes filled and disabled
8. Item appears in user's bucket list page

### Flow 2: Non-Authenticated User Attempting to Save

1. User is NOT logged in
2. User browses public itineraries
3. User clicks heart button
4. System detects no authentication
5. Shows toast: "Please sign in to save to your bucket list"
6. Redirects to `/sign-in?redirectTo=/itinerary/{id}`
7. After sign-in, user is returned to the itinerary
8. User can now click heart button to add to bucket list

### Flow 3: Viewing and Managing Bucket List

1. User is logged in
2. User clicks "Bucket List" in navigation (desktop or mobile)
3. System fetches all bucket list items
4. Displays cards with:
   - Itinerary details
   - Creator name
   - Date added to bucket list
   - "View" button to see full itinerary
   - "Remove" button to remove from bucket list
5. User can remove items
6. Removed items disappear from list immediately

### Flow 4: Duplicate Prevention

1. User adds itinerary to bucket list
2. Heart button becomes filled and disabled
3. If user tries to click again, shows toast: "This itinerary is already in your bucket list!"
4. Database constraint prevents duplicate entries
5. State is synced on component mount

## Technical Details

### State Management

- Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Checks bucket list status on component mount
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX
- Server-side validation and enforcement

### Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) on bucket_list table
- All backend actions verify authentication
- Users can only access their own bucket list
- Cascade deletion when user or itinerary is deleted

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallbacks for network errors
- User-friendly error messages via toast
- Console logging for debugging
- Reverts optimistic updates on failure

## Testing Checklist

### Authentication Tests
- ✅ Non-authenticated user clicks heart → redirected to sign-in
- ✅ Authenticated user clicks heart → added to bucket list
- ✅ Navigation shows "Bucket List" only for authenticated users
- ✅ Direct navigation to `/bucket-list` requires authentication

### Functionality Tests
- ✅ Adding itinerary to bucket list works
- ✅ Removing itinerary from bucket list works
- ✅ Duplicate prevention works (database + UI)
- ✅ Heart button shows correct state (empty vs filled)
- ✅ Bucket list page shows all saved itineraries
- ✅ Itinerary count is accurate
- ✅ Items sorted by date added (newest first)

### UI/UX Tests
- ✅ Heart button has hover effects
- ✅ Filled heart for items in bucket list
- ✅ Toast notifications for all actions
- ✅ Empty state displays properly
- ✅ Loading states work correctly
- ✅ Responsive design on mobile
- ✅ Navigation link appears in correct position

### Edge Cases
- ✅ User tries to add same itinerary twice
- ✅ User removes item while viewing bucket list
- ✅ User adds item then navigates to bucket list
- ✅ Itinerary is deleted (cascade removes from bucket list)
- ✅ User is deleted (cascade removes all bucket list entries)
