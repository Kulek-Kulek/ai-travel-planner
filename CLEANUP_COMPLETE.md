# 🧹 Cleanup Complete - Switched to Pexels!

## ✅ What Was Done:

### **Removed:**
- ❌ `unsplash-js` npm package
- ❌ `src/lib/unsplash/client.ts`
- ❌ `src/components/unsplash-attribution.tsx`
- ❌ Unsplash hostname from `next.config.ts`

### **Kept:**
- ✅ Pexels API integration
- ✅ Smart keyword detection
- ✅ Backfill tool

---

## 📸 Next Step: Replace All Database Images

Your database still has Unsplash URLs. Let's replace them all with Pexels:

### **Option 1: Use Admin UI (Recommended)**

1. **Go to:** http://localhost:3002/admin/backfill-images
2. **Click "Backfill X Itineraries"**
3. Wait ~30 seconds
4. ✅ All done! All images now from Pexels

### **Option 2: SQL Query (Direct Database)**

If you prefer, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- This will clear all image URLs so the backfill tool can repopulate them
UPDATE itineraries 
SET 
  image_url = NULL,
  image_photographer = NULL,
  image_photographer_url = NULL
WHERE image_url LIKE '%unsplash.com%';
```

Then run the backfill tool to fetch new Pexels images.

## 🎉 Benefits of Pexels:

- ✅ **No attribution required** - clean UI
- ✅ **Unlimited requests** - no quotas
- ✅ **No rate limits** - scale infinitely
- ✅ **Free forever** - completely free
- ✅ **High quality** - beautiful photos
- ✅ **Better search** - improved keyword matching

---

## 🧪 Test After Backfill:

1. Go to homepage
2. Check all itinerary cards
3. ✅ All should have beautiful Pexels photos
4. ✅ No attribution badges
5. ✅ Clean, professional look

---

## 📝 Notes:

- New itineraries automatically get Pexels images
- Old itineraries need backfill (one-time process)
- Backfill is safe - can run multiple times
- Each itinerary processed individually
