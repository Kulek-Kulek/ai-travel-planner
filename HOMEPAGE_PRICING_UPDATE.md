# Homepage Pricing Integration - Complete ‚úÖ

## Changes Made

### 1. Renamed Pricing Policy File ‚úÖ
**Changed:** `.cursor/rules/pricing-policy.md` ‚Üí `.cursor/rules/pricing-policy.mdc`

**Reason:** To match the `.mdc` extension used by all other cursor rules files.

---

### 2. Updated Homepage Form (`src/app/page.tsx`) ‚úÖ

#### Import Changes
**Before:**
```tsx
import { ItineraryFormAIEnhanced } from "@/components/itinerary-form-ai-enhanced";
```

**After:**
```tsx
import { ItineraryFormWithPricing, recordItineraryGeneration } from "@/components/itinerary-form-with-pricing";
```

#### Type Updates
Added `pricingModel` field to FormData type to track which AI model was used for billing:
```tsx
type FormData = {
  // ... existing fields
  pricingModel?: string; // Pricing model key from pricing system
};
```

#### Component Replacement
**Before:**
```tsx
<ItineraryFormAIEnhanced
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
  isLoading={mutation.isPending}
  modelOverride="anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku"
  isAuthenticated={isAuthenticated}
  hasResult={!!result || hasCreatedPlanWhileLoggedOut}
/>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<ItineraryFormWithPricing
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
  isLoading={mutation.isPending}
/>
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic model selection dropdown
- ‚úÖ Tier-based access control
- ‚úÖ Usage/credit display
- ‚úÖ Upgrade modals when limits reached
- ‚úÖ Cost preview before generation

#### Success Handler Updates
Added billing/analytics tracking after successful plan generation:

```tsx
onSuccess: async (response, variables) => {
  if (response.success) {
    // Record the generation for billing/analytics
    const pricingModel = (variables as any).pricingModel;
    if (pricingModel && response.data.id) {
      await recordItineraryGeneration(
        response.data.id,
        pricingModel,
        'create'
      ).catch((error) => {
        console.error('Failed to record generation:', error);
        // Don't block the user flow if recording fails
      });
    }
    
    // ... rest of success handling
  }
}
```

**What this does:**
- ‚úÖ Records AI model usage in database
- ‚úÖ Deducts credits for PAYG users
- ‚úÖ Increments usage counters for Pro users
- ‚úÖ Logs cost for analytics
- ‚úÖ Never blocks user flow (errors are caught)

## Database Verification

Check that generations are being recorded:

```sql
-- View recent generations
SELECT 
  p.email,
  l.ai_model,
  l.operation,
  l.estimated_cost,
  l.subscription_tier,
  l.created_at
FROM ai_usage_logs l
JOIN profiles p ON p.id = l.user_id
ORDER BY l.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check user credits/usage
SELECT 
  email,
  subscription_tier,
  credits_balance,
  monthly_economy_used,
  monthly_premium_used,
  plans_created_count
FROM profiles
WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

## Troubleshooting

2. Verify `getUserSubscription()` is returning data
3. Make sure database migration ran successfully

### Issue: Credits not deducting
**Solution:**
1. Check `ai_usage_logs` table for entries
2. Verify `recordItineraryGeneration` is being called (check console logs)
3. Check Supabase RLS policies allow service role to write

### Issue: "User not authenticated" error
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're signed in
2. Check Supabase session is valid
3. Clear browser cookies and sign in again
