# Itinerary Save & Gallery Feature

## 🎯 Overview

This feature implements a complete system for saving, tagging, filtering, and displaying AI-generated travel itineraries. Both anonymous and authenticated users can generate plans, but only authenticated users can mark them as private.

---

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema** (`002_create_itineraries.sql`)
- **`itineraries` table** with:
  - User ID (nullable for anonymous users)
  - Trip details (destination, days, travelers, notes)
  - AI-generated content (full itinerary JSON)
  - **AI-generated tags** for filtering
  - Privacy flag (public/private)
  - Timestamps
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**:
  - Anyone can view public itineraries
  - Users can view their own private itineraries
  - Anonymous users can create public itineraries
  - Authenticated users can create public or private itineraries
  - Users can only update/delete their own itineraries
- **Indexes** for performance:
  - User ID
  - Created date
  - Tags (GIN index for array searching)
  - Privacy flag

### 2. **AI Tagging System** (`ai-actions.ts`)
- **Automatic tag generation** using Claude AI after itinerary creation
- Tags include:
  - **Location**: City, country, region, continent
  - **Duration**: "weekend", "3-5 days", "week-long"
  - **Trip type**: "city break", "beach holiday", "adventure", "cultural"
  - **Group size**: "solo", "couple", "family", "group"
  - **Interests**: "food", "history", "art", "nature", "museums"
  - **Season/weather**: "summer", "winter activities"
  - **Budget**: "budget", "mid-range", "luxury"
- **Fallback tagging** when AI fails (rule-based)
- **Validation**: Tags are cleaned, validated, and limited to 15 per itinerary

### 3. **Server Actions** (`itinerary-actions.ts`)
- `getPublicItineraries()` - Fetch public plans with tag filtering
- `getAllTags()` - Get all unique tags for filter UI
- `getMyItineraries()` - Get authenticated user's plans
- `getItinerary(id)` - Get single itinerary (with privacy check)
- `updateItineraryPrivacy(id, isPrivate)` - Toggle public/private
- `deleteItinerary(id)` - Delete user's itinerary

### 4. **Updated AI Generation** (`ai-actions.ts`)

  - Database ID
  - AI-generated tags
  - Full itinerary content
- Handles both anonymous and authenticated users
- Error handling for database failures
