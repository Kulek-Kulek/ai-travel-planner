## Design Decisions

### Why Pricing is First?
1. **Conversion Priority:** Making pricing visible upfront reduces friction
2. **Transparency:** Users appreciate knowing costs before committing
3. **Trust Building:** Open pricing signals honesty
4. **Early Education:** Users learn about tiers from the start
5. **Competitive Advantage:** Many apps hide pricing - we don't!

### Why Special Styling?
- **Blue color + Sparkles icon:** Associates with "premium" and "value"
- **Semibold font:** Draws attention without being pushy
- **Light background (mobile):** Makes it stand out in menu
- **Consistent branding:** Matches primary blue color scheme

### Why Usage Link for Authenticated Users?
- **Quick Access:** Users want to check credits/limits easily
- **Transparency:** Shows we're confident in our value
- **Engagement:** Encourages users to monitor usage
- **Upsell Opportunity:** Users near limits can upgrade

## Analytics to Track

Monitor these metrics after deploying:

```sql
-- Track pricing page visits
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as visits,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users,
  source_page
FROM analytics_events
WHERE event_type = 'page_view'
AND page_url = '/pricing'
GROUP BY source_page
ORDER BY visits DESC;

-- Track conversion from pricing view to signup
WITH pricing_viewers AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT user_id, session_id
  FROM analytics_events
  WHERE page_url = '/pricing'
),
signups AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT user_id, session_id
  FROM analytics_events
  WHERE event_type = 'signup'
)
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT pv.session_id) as pricing_viewers,
  COUNT(DISTINCT s.session_id) as converted_signups,
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT s.session_id)::numeric / COUNT(DISTINCT pv.session_id) * 100, 2) as conversion_rate
FROM pricing_viewers pv
LEFT JOIN signups s ON s.session_id = pv.session_id;
```

**Key Metrics:**
- Click-through rate to pricing page
- Time spent on pricing page
- Conversion rate (pricing view → signup)
- Upgrade rate (free → paid after viewing pricing)
