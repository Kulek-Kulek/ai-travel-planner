## üîß How to Deploy

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
cd travel-planner

# Option A: Using Supabase CLI
npx supabase db push

# Option B: Manual
# Copy SQL from supabase/migrations/015_add_pricing_system.sql
# Paste into Supabase SQL Editor and run
```

**Verify:**
```sql
-- Check new columns exist
SELECT column_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'profiles' 
AND column_name IN ('credits_balance', 'monthly_economy_used', 'plans_created_count');

-- Check new tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN ('ai_usage_logs', 'rate_limits');
```

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

```env
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_key  # For payments (future)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret                # For payments (future)
```

### Step 3: Update Page to Use New Form

Replace the form import in `src/app/page.tsx`:

```tsx
// OLD:
import { ItineraryFormAIEnhanced } from "@/components/itinerary-form-ai-enhanced";

// NEW:
import { ItineraryFormWithPricing } from "@/components/itinerary-form-with-pricing";

// In component:
<ItineraryFormWithPricing 
  onSubmit={handleSubmit} 
  isLoading={isGenerating} 
/>
```

### Step 4: Record Plan Generation

After successful plan creation, record the generation:

```tsx
import { recordItineraryGeneration } from "@/components/itinerary-form-with-pricing";

// After plan is created
const result = await generateItinerary(formData);
if (result.success && result.id) {
  await recordItineraryGeneration(
    result.id,
    formData.pricingModel,
    'create'
  );
}
```

### Step 5: Add Navigation Links

Update `src/components/nav-header.tsx` or navigation:

```tsx
<Link href="/pricing">Pricing</Link>
<Link href="/usage">Usage</Link>  {/* Protected route */}
```

### Step 6: Test All Tiers

```sql
-- Test as Free user (default)
SELECT subscription_tier FROM profiles WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Upgrade to Pro for testing
UPDATE profiles 
SET subscription_tier = 'pro', 
    billing_cycle_start = NOW(),
    monthly_economy_used = 0,
    monthly_premium_used = 0
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Upgrade to PAYG for testing
UPDATE profiles 
SET subscription_tier = 'payg', 
    credits_balance = 10.00
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

## üìä Cost Monitoring

### Database Queries for Monitoring

```sql
-- Total costs by tier this month
SELECT 
  p.subscription_tier,
  COUNT(*) as user_count,
  SUM(l.estimated_cost) as total_cost,
  AVG(l.estimated_cost) as avg_cost_per_user
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN ai_usage_logs l ON l.user_id = p.id
WHERE l.created_at >= date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY p.subscription_tier;

-- Top spenders (potential abuse)
SELECT 
  p.email,
  p.subscription_tier,
  COUNT(l.id) as generation_count,
  SUM(l.estimated_cost) as total_cost
FROM profiles p
JOIN ai_usage_logs l ON l.user_id = p.id
WHERE l.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY p.id, p.email, p.subscription_tier
ORDER BY total_cost DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Model usage distribution
SELECT 
  ai_model,
  COUNT(*) as usage_count,
  SUM(estimated_cost) as total_cost,
  AVG(estimated_cost) as avg_cost
FROM ai_usage_logs
WHERE created_at >= date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY ai_model
ORDER BY usage_count DESC;

-- Revenue vs Cost (Pro users)
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as pro_users,
  COUNT(*) * 9.99 as monthly_revenue,
  SUM(
    (monthly_economy_used * 0.10) + 
    (monthly_premium_used * 0.30)
  ) as estimated_cost,
  COUNT(*) * 9.99 - SUM(
    (monthly_economy_used * 0.10) + 
    (monthly_premium_used * 0.30)
  ) as profit
FROM profiles
WHERE subscription_tier = 'pro' 
AND subscription_status = 'active';
```

### Set Up Alerts

```sql
-- Create alert function for high usage
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_high_usage_alert()
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
  v_high_users RECORD;
BEGIN
  FOR v_high_users IN
    SELECT 
      p.email,
      SUM(l.estimated_cost) as daily_cost
    FROM profiles p
    JOIN ai_usage_logs l ON l.user_id = p.id
    WHERE l.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE
    GROUP BY p.id, p.email
    HAVING SUM(l.estimated_cost) > 20
  LOOP
    -- Log alert or send notification
    RAISE NOTICE 'High usage alert: % (‚Ç¨%)', 
      v_high_users.email, 
      v_high_users.daily_cost;
  END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails
```bash
# Check current migration version
npx supabase db status

# Reset if needed (CAREFUL: development only)
npx supabase db reset

# Or run migration manually
psql -U postgres -d your_db < supabase/migrations/015_add_pricing_system.sql
```

### User Can't Generate Plans
1. Check subscription tier: `SELECT subscription_tier FROM profiles WHERE id = '...'`
2. Check credits: `SELECT credits_balance FROM profiles WHERE id = '...'`
3. Check rate limits: `SELECT * FROM rate_limits WHERE user_id = '...'`
4. Check usage logs: `SELECT * FROM ai_usage_logs WHERE user_id = '...' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10`

### Costs Not Recording
1. Check if `recordPlanGeneration()` is being called after plan creation
2. Check `ai_usage_logs` table for entries
3. Check console for errors in browser/server logs
4. Verify Supabase RLS policies allow service role to insert

### Upgrade Modal Not Showing
1. Check if `ItineraryFormWithPricing` component is being used
2. Verify `getUserSubscription()` is returning correct tier
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure `UpgradeModal` component is imported correctly
