## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Local Development
- [ ] Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Visit `/pricing` page
- [ ] Verify PAYG card shows "‚Ç¨1-‚Ç¨1.75"
- [ ] Verify credit packs show ranges (e.g., "1-2 plans")
- [ ] Check model table shows individual costs
- [ ] Test model selection dropdown shows costs

### Functional Testing
```bash
# Test with economy model
1. Sign up as new user
2. Add ‚Ç¨5 credits
3. Generate plan with Gemini Flash (‚Ç¨1.00)
4. Verify balance: 5.00 ‚Üí 4.00

# Test with premium model
5. Generate plan with GPT-4o (‚Ç¨1.75)
6. Verify balance: 4.00 ‚Üí 2.25

# Test with mixed models
7. Generate with Claude Haiku (‚Ç¨1.35)
8. Verify balance: 2.25 ‚Üí 0.90
9. Try GPT-4o ‚Üí should fail (insufficient funds)
10. Can still use Gemini Flash (‚Ç¨1.00) ‚Üê insufficient, need ‚Ç¨1.00
```

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Check user credits and usage
SELECT 
  email,
  credits_balance,
  subscription_tier
FROM profiles
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Check usage logs with costs
SELECT 
  model_used,
  operation,
  credits_deducted,
  created_at
FROM ai_usage_logs
WHERE user_id = 'xxx'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Verify cost tracking
SELECT 
  model_used,
  COUNT(*) as generations,
  SUM(credits_deducted) as total_cost
FROM ai_usage_logs
WHERE user_id = 'xxx'
GROUP BY model_used;
```

---

## üîç How It Works

### Credit Deduction Flow
```typescript
// 1. User selects model in form
const selectedModel = 'gpt-4o'; // Cost: ‚Ç¨1.75

// 2. Before generation - check balance
const canGenerate = await canGeneratePlan(userId, selectedModel);
// Returns: { allowed: true, cost: 1.75 }

// 3. Show cost to user
<ModelSelector 
  models={availableModels}
  onSelect={(model) => showCost(model.cost)}
/>

// 4. Generate itinerary
const itinerary = await generateItinerary(...);

// 5. Deduct from balance
await recordPlanGeneration(itinerary.id, selectedModel, 'create');
// Database: credits_balance = credits_balance - 1.75

// 6. Log for analytics
// ai_usage_logs: { model: 'gpt-4o', cost: 1.75, timestamp: now() }
```

### Stripe Integration (Unchanged)
```
User purchases ‚Ç¨5 credit pack:
1. Stripe charges ‚Ç¨5.00
2. Webhook adds ‚Ç¨5.00 to credits_balance
3. User sees: "‚Ç¨5.00 available"
4. User can generate:
   - 5 economy plans (5 √ó ‚Ç¨1.00)
   - OR 2 premium plans (2 √ó ‚Ç¨1.75 = ‚Ç¨3.50, with ‚Ç¨1.50 left)
   - OR mix of both
```
