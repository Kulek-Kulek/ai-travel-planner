# 🔒 Private Plans Management Features

## Overview

---

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### New Migration: `003_add_itinerary_status.sql`

Adds a `status` column to track itinerary lifecycle:
- **`active`** - Currently planning (default)
- **`completed`** - Trip finished
- **`archived`** - Old/inactive plans

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Run this migration in Supabase!**

```sql
-- Copy and paste in Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
alter table itineraries 
add column status text default 'active' not null 
check (status in ('active', 'completed', 'archived'));

create index itineraries_status_idx on itineraries(status);

comment on column itineraries.status is 'Status of the itinerary: active (planning), completed (traveled), archived (old)';
```
