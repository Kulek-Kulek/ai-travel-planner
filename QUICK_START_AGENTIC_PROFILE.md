# Quick Start: Agentic Travel Profile System

## 🎯 What We're Building

Transform your travel planner with AI-powered personalization:
1. **Fun 2-minute quiz** that users actually want to complete
2. **AI-generated travel profile** using agentic reasoning
3. **Profile-aware itineraries** that feel personally crafted

## 📅 Timeline: 5-6 Weeks

```
Week 1-2: Build Profile System
Week 3:   Test & Refine Profiles  
Week 4-5: Upgrade Itinerary Generation
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Read the Full Plan
Open `AGENTIC_TRAVEL_PROFILE_PLAN.md` for detailed implementation

### Step 2: Database Setup (Day 1)
Run this migration first:

```sql
-- supabase/migrations/018_add_travel_profile_fields.sql
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN travel_personality TEXT,
ADD COLUMN profile_summary TEXT,
ADD COLUMN accommodation_preferences TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
ADD COLUMN activity_preferences TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
ADD COLUMN dining_preferences TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
ADD COLUMN quiz_responses JSONB,
ADD COLUMN quiz_completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN profile_version INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
ADD COLUMN profile_confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2);
```

### Step 3: Create Type Definitions (Day 1)
Copy from plan: `src/types/travel-profile.ts`

### Step 4: Build Quiz Component (Day 2-3)
Copy from plan: `src/components/travel-profile-quiz.tsx`

### Step 5: Create Server Action (Day 4-5)
Copy from plan: `src/lib/actions/profile-ai-actions.ts`
- This includes the full agentic prompt with few-shot examples

### Step 6: Test Profile Generation (Day 6-12)
- Complete quiz with different personalities
- Verify AI output quality
- Refine prompt based on results

### Step 7: Upgrade Itinerary Generation (Week 4)
- Fetch user profile in `generateItinerary`
- Update `buildPrompt` to agentic approach
- Include profile in itinerary reasoning

### Step 8: A/B Test (Week 5)
- Compare old vs new approach
- Measure satisfaction improvement
- Optimize costs

## 💰 Expected Costs

- **Profile generation**: ~$0.05-0.10 per user (one-time)
- **Itinerary with profile**: ~$0.40-0.60 per generation
- **Total per user**: <$1.00 for profile + first itinerary

Using Claude Haiku for profiles, Claude Sonnet for itineraries.

## 🎨 Key Features

### Quiz Experience

- Editable/retakeable

### Personalized Itineraries
- Every activity explained with "why this fits you"
- Pro tips based on profile
- Pacing matches preferences
- Budget aligns with comfort level
- Interests drive all recommendations

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track these:
- ✅ Quiz completion rate (target: 80%+)
- ✅ Profile accuracy rating (target: 4.5/5)
- ✅ Itinerary satisfaction improvement (target: 50%+)
- ✅ User retention increase
- ✅ Cost per user (target: <$1)

## 🔧 Tech Stack

**No new dependencies needed!**
- ✅ OpenRouter (already configured)
- ✅ Supabase (already configured)
- ✅ Next.js Server Actions (already using)
- ✅ shadcn/ui components (already using)

Just adding:
- New database columns
- New TypeScript types
- Enhanced prompts
- Quiz UI components

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By building this, you'll master:

1. **Agentic Prompt Engineering**
   - Chain-of-thought reasoning
   - Few-shot learning
   - Self-correction patterns
   - Consistency validation

2. **Personalization Architecture**
   - Profile data modeling
   - Context injection
   - Progressive enhancement
   - Graceful degradation

3. **AI Quality Control**
   - Output validation
   - Confidence scoring
   - A/B testing
   - Cost optimization

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't skip the examples**: Few-shot examples are 50% of quality
2. **Don't make quiz too long**: Max 15 questions or completion drops
3. **Don't ignore edge cases**: Test with unusual combinations
4. **Don't forget validation**: Always validate AI outputs with Zod
5. **Don't optimize too early**: Get it working, then optimize

## 📝 Next Steps

### Ready to Start?

1. **Switch to Agent Mode** (if not already)
2. **Choose starting point**:
   - Option A: Follow plan sequentially (recommended)
   - Option B: Start with database + types (quick setup)
   - Option C: Build quiz UI first (visual progress)

3. **Let me know and I'll help you**:
   - Create the database migration
   - Build the quiz component
   - Write the agentic prompts
   - Set up testing infrastructure

### Questions to Consider

Before starting:
- Do you want to test with a subset of users first?
- Should quiz be required or optional?
- Where in signup flow should quiz appear?
- Should existing users be prompted to take quiz?

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start simple**: Get basic profile working before adding complexity
2. **Test constantly**: Use OpenRouter playground to test prompts
3. **Iterate prompts**: Your first prompt won't be perfect - iterate!
4. **Monitor costs**: Set up alerts if costs exceed expectations
5. **Collect feedback**: Ask users if profile feels accurate
