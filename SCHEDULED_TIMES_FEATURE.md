## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Updated AI Prompt (`ai-actions.ts`)

**New Instructions:**
```typescript
Create a detailed day-by-day travel plan with SPECIFIC SCHEDULED TIMES for each activity. 
Build a realistic daily schedule that:
- Starts around 8:00-9:00 AM
- Includes specific time slots for each attraction/activity (e.g., "9:00 AM - 11:00 AM")
- Accounts for meal times (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
- Includes realistic travel time between locations
- Ends around 8:00-10:00 PM
- Leaves breathing room between activities (don't over-schedule)
```

**Critical Requirements:**
- Use SPECIFIC TIME RANGES (not durations)
- Create sequential schedule (no overlaps)
- Include meals as scheduled places
- Times realistic for activity type
- Match time format to user's language (24-hour vs AM/PM)

### 2. Enhanced UI Display

**Homepage Preview (`page.tsx`):**
```tsx
<div className="flex items-start gap-3">
  <div className="flex-shrink-0 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-md px-2 py-1 text-xs font-bold">
    {place.time}
  </div>
  <div className="flex-1">
    <p className="font-semibold">{place.name}</p>
    <p className="text-sm text-slate-600">{place.desc}</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Full Itinerary View (`itinerary/[id]/page.tsx`):**
```tsx
<div className="flex items-start gap-4">
  {/* Time Badge */}
  <div className="flex-shrink-0">
    <div className="bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-lg px-3 py-2 min-w-[120px]">
      <Clock className="w-4 h-4" />
      <div className="text-sm font-bold">
        {place.time}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  {/* Place Details */}
  <div className="flex-1">
    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">{place.name}</h3>
    <p className="text-gray-700">{place.desc}</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 3. Schema (No Changes Required)

The existing schema already supports strings, so no database migration needed:
```typescript
const aiResponseSchema = z.object({
  city: z.string(),
  days: z.array(
    z.object({
      title: z.string(),
      places: z.array(
        z.object({
          name: z.string(),
          desc: z.string(),
          time: z.string(), // Now contains "9:00 AM - 11:00 AM" instead of "2 hours"
        }),
      ),
    }),
  ),
});
```
