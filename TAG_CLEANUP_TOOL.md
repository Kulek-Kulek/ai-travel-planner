    "france",
    "europe",
    "10 days",
    "10-day-trip",
    "romantic",
    "couple",

    "food",
    "art",
    "history"
  ]
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "abc123",

  "tags": [
    "week-long",
    "romantic",
    "couple",
    "city break",
    "food",
    "art",
    "history"
  ]
}
```

**Result**: 12 tags ‚Üí 7 tags (removed 5 redundant tags)

## When to Use

### ‚úÖ Good Times to Run Cleanup

- After importing legacy data
- After changing tag generation logic
- When you notice too many location-based tags in filters
- When users report confusing or duplicate filter options
- After initial setup with test data

### ‚ùå Don't Run Cleanup

- While users are actively creating itineraries (low risk, but avoid anyway)
- If you're unsure about the results (preview first!)
- Without checking preview results first

## Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" Error
- **Solution**: Make sure you're logged in as an admin
- Check your `profiles` table has `is_admin = true`

### Preview Shows No Changes
- **Good news**: Your tags are already clean!
- All itineraries already have proper tags without destinations

### Too Many Tags Removed
- **Review**: Check the preview console logs
- **Verify**: Make sure destination search is working (tags don't need destinations)
- **Remember**: Destination names aren't needed as tags (users search by destination)

### Need to Undo Changes
- **Option 1**: Re-generate itineraries (tags will be recreated)
- **Option 2**: Restore from database backup (if you made one)
- **Option 3**: Manually edit tags in database for specific itineraries

## Technical Details

### Server Actions

- **`previewTagCleanup()`**: Simulates cleanup without changing database
- **`cleanAllTags()`**: Performs actual cleanup and updates database

### Logic

1. Fetches all itineraries with tags
2. For each itinerary:
   - Filters out destination-related tags
   - Removes common countries/cities
   - Deduplicates similar variations
   - Normalizes format
3. Only updates itineraries where tags actually changed
4. Returns statistics on changes made

### Performance

- Handles hundreds of itineraries efficiently
- Processes sequentially to avoid overwhelming database
- Logs progress for monitoring
- Typically completes in 5-15 seconds

## Best Practices

1. **Always preview first** before running cleanup
2. **Check console logs** to understand what will change
3. **Run during low-traffic times** if you have many itineraries
4. **Verify results** after cleanup by checking a few itineraries
5. **Consider database backup** before first run (optional but safe)

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
- Batch processing with progress bar
- Undo functionality
- Selective cleanup (by date range or specific tags)
- Scheduled automatic cleanup
- Tag usage statistics before/after
