// System automatically checks user's plan
const subscriptionInfo = await getUserSubscription();
const isPaidUser = subscriptionInfo && subscriptionInfo.tier !== 'free';

// Routes to appropriate generation method
if (isPaidUser) {
  // 3-pass: Generate → Validate → Refine
} else {
  // 1-pass: Generate with profile
}
```
