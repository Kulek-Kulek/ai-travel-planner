# Upgrade Modal Feature

## Overview
When users hit their free tier limit (2 itineraries), they now see a beautiful modal dialog instead of just a toast notification, encouraging them to upgrade.

## Implementation

### Components Created

#### 1. `upgrade-modal.tsx`
A reusable modal component built with shadcn/ui Dialog that displays:
- Eye-catching crown icon with gradient background
- Clear title and description
- List of premium features with icons
- Call-to-action button linking to `/pricing`
- "Maybe Later" dismiss button
- Full-screen backdrop overlay

**Props:**
```typescript
interface UpgradeModalProps {
  open: boolean;              // Controls modal visibility
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void;  // Handler for close/open
  title?: string;             // Custom title (default: "Free Tier Limit Reached")
  description?: string;       // Custom description
  features?: string[];        // List of features to highlight
}
```

### Integration in `page.tsx`

#### State Management
Added `showUpgradeModal` state to control the modal:
```typescript
const [showUpgradeModal, setShowUpgradeModal] = useState(false);
```

#### Error Handling
Updated the `onSuccess` callback in the mutation to detect limit errors:
```typescript
// Check if this is a tier limit error
const errorMessage = response.error || "";
const isTierLimitError = 
  errorMessage.toLowerCase().includes("limit reached") ||
  errorMessage.toLowerCase().includes("tier limit") ||
  errorMessage.toLowerCase().includes("upgrade");

if (isTierLimitError) {
  // Show upgrade modal instead of toast for limit errors
  setShowUpgradeModal(true);
} else {
  // Show regular error toast for other errors
  toast.error("Failed to generate itinerary", {
    description: response.error,
  });
}
```

#### Modal Component
Added the modal to the page JSX:
```typescript
<UpgradeModal 
  open={showUpgradeModal} 
  onOpenChange={setShowUpgradeModal}
/>
```

## User Experience Flow

### When Limit is Reached
1. User attempts to create their 3rd itinerary (free tier allows 2)
2. Backend returns error: "Free tier limit reached (2 plans)"
3. Frontend detects the limit error in the mutation response
4. Instead of showing a toast, opens the upgrade modal
5. Modal displays with:
   - ✨ Crown icon in gradient circle
   - "Free Tier Limit Reached" title
   - Explanation text
   - 5 key benefits of upgrading
   - "View Plans & Pricing" button → `/pricing`
   - "Maybe Later" button to dismiss

### Features Highlighted in Modal
1. ✨ Unlimited AI-powered itineraries
2. ✨ All AI models (including premium)
3. ⚡ Priority generation
4. ⚡ Unlimited edits & regenerations
5. ⚡ Save & organize all your plans

## Customization

The modal is fully customizable via props. Example custom usage:

```typescript
<UpgradeModal 
  open={showModal}
  onOpenChange={setShowModal}
  title="Unlock Premium Features"
  description="Get access to advanced AI models and unlimited plans!"
  features={[
    "GPT-4o and Claude models",
    "Priority support",
    "Advanced analytics"
  ]}
/>
```

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies Installed
- `@radix-ui/react-dialog` (via shadcn/ui dialog component)

### Files Modified
1. `src/components/upgrade-modal.tsx` - New modal component
2. `src/app/page.tsx` - Integration and error handling
3. `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx` - Auto-generated by shadcn/ui

### Files Related
- `src/lib/actions/ai-actions.ts` - Returns the limit error
- `src/lib/actions/subscription-actions.ts` - Checks usage limits

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Create a free tier account
2. Generate 2 itineraries (should work fine)
3. Attempt to generate a 3rd itinerary
4. Verify:
   - ✅ No toast appears
   - ✅ Modal opens with backdrop
   - ✅ Modal shows correct title and description
   - ✅ All 5 features are listed with icons
   - ✅ "View Plans & Pricing" button works
   - ✅ "Maybe Later" dismisses the modal
   - ✅ Clicking backdrop dismisses the modal
   - ✅ ESC key dismisses the modal

### Edge Cases
- Modal won't show for other error types (network, validation, etc.)
- Only tier limit errors trigger the modal
- Other errors still show as toast notifications

## Design Choices

### Why Modal vs Toast?
- **More prominent**: Users can't miss it
- **Better conversion**: More space for benefits
- **Blocks action**: Prevents frustration of repeated failures
- **Better UX**: Clear path forward (upgrade link)

### Visual Design
- Crown icon reinforces "premium" concept
- Gradient backgrounds add visual appeal
- Icons distinguish feature types (Sparkles for core, Zap for advanced)
- Primary button for upgrade, ghost for dismiss
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements:
- Add pricing preview in modal
- Include testimonials or social proof
- A/B test different messaging
- Track conversion rate from modal
- Add animation when opening
